# Privacy Policy

The term "application" used in this document will refer to the application *Poffin Master*.

The application does not collect or store any personal data about the user, and it doesn't track any usage done by the user of the application.

The **only** data used by the application is the device language, to display texts to the user's chosen language if a translation is available.
This data is collected only during application startup and is **not stored** anywhere (local or remote).

## Why no data collection?

The application does not need to collect any data, because:
- No ads displayed to the user
- No analytics used
- No account or any other kind of identification needed
- No access to anything else on the device than the application itself
- No request sent over the network to fill hidden and obscure databases
- No sensitive device data used (like passwords, biometrics, etc.)
